## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn image semantics of figure and figcaption,
flexbox how to center using justify content and alian items,
I also learn how to center images.

  <figure>
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code image">

      <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
      <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>

```
```css
body{
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

img{
    display: block;
    width: 92%;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-top: 14px;
    padding: 0;
    border-radius: 10px ;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to learn the mobile first workflow in the future.


### Useful resources

- [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - This helped me learn image semantics using figure and figcaption. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the use of the flexbox and image centering. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
